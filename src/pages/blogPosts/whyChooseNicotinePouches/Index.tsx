			<h1 className={styles.mainTitle}>Why Choose Nicotine Pouches as a Smoke-Free Alternative?</h1>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>While adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke have had the option of 
			certain vapes and tobacco heating devices to consider, nicotine pouches are more 
			discreet than these other types of smoke-free alternatives, with no vapour or device 
			maintenance typically needed to experience nicotine. All this considered, nicotine 
			pouches offer a more discreet way of experiencing nicotine – being smoke-free, 
			vapour-free and device-free.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Take ZYN as an example here. ZYN is the innovative, high-quality alternative to 
			smoking that delivers unique flavours and a smoke-free nicotine experience.</p>
			
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>ZYN nicotine pouches are a new product from PMI, that blends more than 100 years of 
			Swedish/Nordic expertise and tradition in manufacturing oral nicotine products and an 
			uncompromising approach to quality. Using ZYN is easy:</p>

			<ol className={styles.list}>
				<li className={styles.listItem}>Break the seal to open the can. </li>
	     		<li className={styles.listItem}> Pop a ZYN® pouch under your lip. </li>
        		<li className={styles.listItem}>You may experience a tingling sensation that we call ZYNGLE. </li>
				<></>
			</ol>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Keep reading and discover why nicotine pouches are a smoke-free alternative worth 
			considering. You’ll also find answers to common questions including ‘how long do 
			nicotine pouches last’ and ‘how long do I keep nicotine pouches in for’. </p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>Strength in Simplicity</h2>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>One of the main improvements often tied to nicotine pouches compared to cigarettes is 
			how simple and easy they are to use. Unlike cigarettes - or smoke-free alternatives like 
			vapes - nicotine pouches are device free, and only require you to place one of the 
			products under your lip for a nicotine experience. With nicotine pouches, there’s no set 
			up or maintenance needed either. Nicotine pouches are ready to use straight out of 
			their packaging, and once finished with, can be disposed of simply and responsibly. </p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>They Accommodate Different 
			Preferences</h2>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>The way you use nicotine pouches differs significantly to smoking and other common 
			smoke-free alternatives - and may do so in a way that better matches your 
			preferences. While the specifics of nicotine pouches will depend on the product in 
			question, usually, these come as small, pillow-shaped pouches you can place in your 
			mouth for up to a certain amount of time. To give you a better understanding of how 
			nicotine pouches operate, we’ve answered a few common questions about their 
			experience below. </p>
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>How long do nicotine pouches last? Nicotine pouches can last for up to half an hour - 
			although exactly how long they last will depend on what specific product you’re using. </p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>How long can I keep nicotine pouches in for? This question correlates with how long 
			the nicotine experience they provide lasts for in the mouth, but you don’t have to keep 
			them in for the maximum length of time. You could take these pouches out once you’ve 
			had enough of the experience. When you start using a pouch, you might experience a 
			tingling sensation - which is connected to the pouch’s release of nicotine and flavours.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>How long do nicotine pouches take to work? Nicotine pouches may start working 
			within five minutes of using them, although this could vary. <Link to="../blog/how-do-nicotine-pouches-work"> Find out more on the timeline 
			of using a nicotine pouch and how they work. </Link></p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>No More Smoking Areas</h2>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>As nicotine pouches don’t produce vapour or smoke, when in public spaces you won’t 
			be limited to using them in the designated smoking area. This could minimise how 
			nicotine experiences interrupt your day.</p>

			<h2 className={styles.paragraph}>No More Interruptions</h2>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Not only could switching to nicotine pouches help you avoid smoking areas, they can 
			also stop your nicotine experiences interrupting other aspects of your life too. As this 
			product is so discreet, you could use them while commuting to work, in the office and 
			on long haul-flights, rather than having to wait until you’re outside for a nicotine 
			moment. In being smoke-free, tobacco-free and device-free, nicotine pouches might 
			not cause any bother to those around you either. That said, there are some instances 
			you shouldn’t interrupt with a nicotine pouch, which we’ve explored below.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Can you drink with a nicotine pouch in? While hypothetically you might be able to 
			drink a beverage with a nicotine pouch in, it may not be the best idea - as this could 
			increase the risk of you swallowing the pouch. Nicotine pouches are not designed to be 
			ingested, and should be taken out once you’re finished with them and stored or 
			disposed of responsibly. </p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Can you eat with nicotine pouches? Similar to drinking with a nicotine pouch, while 
			yes, it is physically possible, it might be best to avoid eating while you have a pouch in 
			your mouth. This could also help to minimise the risk of swallowing these products. </p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Our article on 
				<Link to="../faq#whatHappensIfIngestZyn-14"> what happens if you swallow a nicotine pouch</Link> offers further insights on 
			this topic. </p>

			<h2 className={styles.paragraph}>You Could Bring Them on 
			Holiday</h2>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Provided that nicotine pouches are allowed at your destination and place of departure, 
			you might find that this product is easier to bring on holiday too. While the use of 
			vapes is generally banned in airports and on planes, depending on where and who 
			you’re flying with, nicotine pouches may not be. </p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Can you take nicotine pouches on a plane? You might be able to fly with nicotine 
			pouches. However, be sure to check with your airline before travel to confirm their own 
			rules around bringing nicotine pouches on a plane, and for advice on how to store them 
			during the journey. </p>

			<h2 className={styles.paragraph}>A Conversation Starter</h2>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>If you have friends who are adult smokers and would otherwise continue to smoke, 
			they may be curious about your switch to nicotine pouches - and might even start 
			considering it themselves. </p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>As a recent innovation in the UK, nicotine pouches can become a real conversation 
			starter, and one you don’t have to excuse yourself from to use outside. Nicotine 
			pouches can be a modern tobacco-free and smoke-free alternative for nicotine users. 
			Although nicotine pouches haven’t been around long in the UK, they are popular with 
			existing smokers and nicotine users in Scandinavia, and elsewhere, because they are a 
			simple and convenient smoke-free and tobacco-free way to experience nicotine. </p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Nicotine pouches could make nicotine better fit around you and your lifestyle. At ZYN, 
			our nicotine pouches come in a variety of different flavours and sizes. <Link to=".."> Browse the full 
			range </Link> to discover which ones best suit you.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Smoke-free products are not risk-free and provide nicotine, which is addictive. The best 
			decision any adult smoker can make is to quit tobacco and nicotine use altogether. 
			Smoke-free products are not alternatives to quitting and are not designed as cessation 
			aids. </p>
