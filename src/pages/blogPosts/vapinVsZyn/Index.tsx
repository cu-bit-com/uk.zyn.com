			<h1 className={styles.mainTitle}>ZYN and Vaping: Assessing 
			Tobacco-Free Options</h1>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>A number of smoke-free and tobacco-free nicotine products have risen in popularity over the last 5 -10 years - including vapes and  
				<Link to="../blog/how-do-nicotine-pouches-work"> nicotine pouches</Link>. Depending on the product, these can both also be alternatives for adult smokers to consider switching to over continuing to smoke. </p>
			
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>There are many different vapes available on the market for those wanting to go tobacco-free. What’s more, there’s also now a range of tobacco-free nicotine pouches to discover.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>In this article, we’ll explore the tobacco-free options available and the ways in which you can experience nicotine without smoke or vapour. Along with examining the pros and cons of nicotine pouches, we’ll also explore answers to questions like ‘is ZYN better than vaping?’ and how these two smoke-free, tobacco-free products compare. </p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>Why Use Tobacco-Free Alternatives?</h2>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Switching to smoke-free, tobacco-free alternatives to cigarettes can help adult smokers avoid some of the harmful substances in tobacco smoke. When a cigarette is lit, it produces thousands of chemicals, with 100 of these associated with smoking related diseases. While the exact substances that nicotine pouches and vapes produce should be substantiated on a product-by-product basis, neither of them should produce tobacco smoke. Take our pod based vape VEEV ONE as an example here. VEEV ONE emits on average 99% lower levels of harmful chemicals compared to cigaretes.*</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Important information: this does not necessarily equal a 99% reduction in risk. VEEV ONE is not risk-free.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>* 99% less” represents the average reductions in levels of a range of harmful chemicals (excluding nicotine) compared to the smoke of a reference cigarette. See Important Information on

			</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>What’s more, nicotine pouches do not produce ash, smoke, or a smoke smell. </p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>Nicotine Pouches as a Tobacco-Free Alternative</h2>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Nicotine pouches are a modern, tobacco-free and smoke-free alternative for nicotine users. Although they haven’t been around long in the UK, nicotine pouches are a popular smoke-free alternative in Scandinavia and elsewhere, because they are a simple and convenient smoke-free and tobacco-free way to experience nicotine. There are a number of different nicotine pouch products currently on the market, 
				including <Link to="../discover-zyn">ZYN.</Link>  </p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Is ZYN tobacco-free? Yes, nicotine pouches do not contain tobacco, and this includes ZYN’s nicotine pouch range. ZYN tobacco-free pouches do, however, contain nicotine, and there’s no such thing as a ZYN nicotine-free pouch.  </p>

 			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Nicotine pouches typically contain nicotine, plant-based fibres and flavourings - although the exact ingredients in a nicotine pouch will depend on the product in question. </p>

			 <h2 className={styles.subTitle}>Vaping as a Tobacco-Free 
			 Alternative</h2>
			
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Vaping could be a smoke-free and tobacco-free alternative to continued smoking - depending on the product in question. Typically, instead of tobacco, vapes heat an eliquid - producing vapour rather than tobacco smoke. This e-liquid often contains nicotine as well as flavourings and other ingredients like Propylene Glycol (PG) and Vegetable Glyerin (VG). For example, VEEV ONE liquids are made using high quality ingredients. VEEV ONE features a compact ceramic heating technology, and there’s a new mini ceramic heater in every VEEV ONE pod. Each pod is pre-filled with e-liquid, and pod insertion is aided by magnetic connector onto the device body. </p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Not every vape will operate similar to VEEV ONE though. There are a range of other rechargeable vapes that may work differently, as well as disposable options, too. So, that’s on what vapes and nicotine pouches are, but how do the two compare? Is ZYN better than vaping? And what are the pros and cons of nicotine pouches? Let’s now explore vaping vs ZYN. </p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>ZYN vs Vapes: Are ZYN Pouches 
			Better Than Vaping?</h2>
			
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>When exploring the world of tobacco-free nicotine products, it’s natural to have 
			questions on how they all compare for existing smokers or nicotine users. For those 
			wondering 'is ZYN better than vaping?’ Or wanting to examine ZYN vs vapes, the 
			answer isn’t completely black and white. Both tobacco-free alternatives offer their own 
			experiences, so exactly which one is better for you can be influenced by your own 
			personal preferences</p>
			
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>When it comes to ZYN pouches vs vaping, one key thing to know is that nicotine 
			pouches don’t require a device and are quite straightforward to use - simply place the 
			small, white pouch between your upper lip and gum to experience the nicotine and 
			flavour. Vapes on the other hand do require a device to turn the e-liquid into the 
			vapour you use. This can be either a pro or a con, depending on how you look at it. 
			While a device takes up more space, and needs more maintenance than using a 
			nicotine pouch, this does arguably mean the vaping experience is more customisable. </p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>ZYN vs Vaping - Usage in Public 
			Spaces</h2>
 
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>One key factor to consider in the vaping vs ZYN debate is where you can use these two 
			tobacco free alternatives. As both products offer different experiences, how and where 
			you can use them in public may differ.</p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>Using Vapes Indoors</h2>
 
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Although vaping indoors is not illegal, pubs, clubs, cafes, bars and other venues (e.g. 
			concert halls and stadiums), may have set their own rules on usage within these 
			spaces. A lot of indoor public spaces ban vaping on their premises, or restrict it to 
			certain areas. That said, it’s always best to check. If you’re caught vaping in any venues which have banned the use of e-cigarettes, you may be asked to leave - but again, this 
			will depend on the venue and its management. Vaping is also generally banned on 
			public transport. 
			</p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>Using Nicotine Pouches Indoors</h2>
 
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Nicotine pouches, on the other hand, can be used more discreetly and do not produce 
			vapour, and as such, can be allowed in indoor public spaces where vaping is not. Plus, 
			these tobacco-free nicotine pouches are also low maintenance, with no recharging 
			needed. 
			</p>
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>This is one of the main benefits of ZYN pouches when it comes to the ZYN vs vape 
			debate. Let’s use a concert as an example - those who vape may have to leave the 
			venue and miss part of the show - whereas nicotine pouch users (provided the venue 
			allows them) could use a pouch without disruption. </p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>ZYN vs Vaping - Flavour</h2>
	
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>The flavour experience of vaping vs ZYN and nicotine pouches is different, too. With 
			nicotine pouches, the flavour experience provided with a specific pouch is set and can’t 
			be altered. With vaping, you might be able to adjust the flavour experience to your 
			preferences, depending on the vape you’re using - doing this by changing e-liquids and 
			adjusting features like the wattage and airflow. However, this is only the case with 
			certain devices, and if you want to change the flavour of your nicotine pouch, you can 
			simply choose a different flavour option.
			</p>
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>ZYN comes in a range pouch sizes, flavours and nicotine strengths, each thoughtfully 
			designed for your nicotine moments. All this considered, is ZYN better than vaping 
			from a flavour perspective? While it depends on the vape you’re comparing it to, our 
			variety of ZYN flavours have been developed to deliver an excellent taste experience 
			whatever flavour you choose. One of the ZYN benefits is that they are available in a 
			wide range of flavours, from Cool Mint to Chili Guava, Citrus and more. </p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>Which Tobacco-Free Alternative is 
			Right for Me?</h2>
 
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>With a broader understanding of different tobacco-free nicotine products, you can now 
			choose the one which works best for you. ZYN nicotine pouches are a suitable option 
			to consider if you want to move away from consuming nicotine using tobacco or the act 
			of combustion. However, as with choosing any product, it’s important to do your 
			research and discover what works best for you.
			</p>
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Smoke-free products are not risk-free and provide nicotine, which is addictive. The best 
			decision any adult smoker can make is to quit tobacco and nicotine use altogether. 
			Smoke-free products are not alternatives to quitting and are not designed as cessation 
			aids. </p>
