			<h1 className={styles.mainTitle}>What Is Nicotine?</h1>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Nicotine is an addictive substance that’s derived from certain types of plants  . It’s also typically found in cigarettes, as well as smoke-free alternatives like nicotine pouches and consumables for tobacco heating devices.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Nicotine is a chemical that’s found in tobacco plants, which are a member of the ‘nightshade’ family. You may have heard that tomatoes contain nicotine and this is true. The nightshade family of plants also includes other vegetables and fruits, including peppers and potatoes. However, while tomatoes do contain nicotine, they contain far lower levels of this substance compared to tobacco.</p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>Is Nicotine a Stimulant?</h2>
			
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Yes, nicotine is a stimulant. What this means is that nicotine can have a stimulating, physiological effect when consumed.     The substance may impact adult users in different ways. What’s important to know is that as nicotine is addictive, it isn’t risk-free.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>While nicotine isn’t risk-free, in products like cigarettes, it’s not the main substance adult smokers are exposed to that cause certain smoking-related diseases. To smoke a cigarette, a process called combustion has to occur, which is responsible for creating cigarette smoke. This smoke contains numerous chemicals that are associated with smoking-related diseases, such as carbon monoxide. Nicotine is not the main cause for these smoking-related diseases. That said, it is an addictive substance. </p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>Is Nicotine Bad for You?</h2>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>The best decision for any adult smoker is to stop smoking and nicotine use entirely. Nicotine is not risk-free and is addictive. However, for those who would otherwise continue to smoke, smoke-free nicotine products may be a better option to switch to. </p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>One example of a smoke-free alternative to smoking cigarettes could be nicotine pouches.    Unlike cigarettes, nicotine pouches are typically combustion-free and smoke-free. Generally being smoke-free, tobacco-free and device free, nicotine pouches may not cause any bother to those around you, nor do they usually leave any smoke smell or odour on hair or clothes like cigarettes.    Typically, nicotine pouches are small, convenient and simple to use.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Take our range of nicotine pouch products ZYN as an example. ZYN is the innovative, high-quality alternative to smoking that delivers unique flavours and a smoke-free nicotine experience wherever, whenever.   ZYN nicotine pouches are a new product from PMI, that blends more than 100 years of Swedish/Nordic expertise and tradition in manufacturing oral nicotine products and an uncompromising approach to quality.</p>
