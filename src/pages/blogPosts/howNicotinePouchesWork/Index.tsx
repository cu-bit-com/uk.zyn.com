			<h1 className={styles.mainTitle}>How Do Nicotine Pouches Work?</h1>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Nicotine pouches don’t require any device and are simple to use – you just place the small, white pouches between your upper lip and gum and experience the flavour and nicotine as they are released.   However, exactly how to use nicotine pouches will depend on the product in question.</p>
			
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>For adult smokers transitioning from continued smoking to ZYN nicotine pouches  specifically, using ZYN is easy:</p>

			<ul className={styles.list}>
				<li className={styles.listItem}>Break the seal to open the can.</li>
				<li className={styles.listItem}>Pop a ZYN pouch under your lip.</li>
				<li className={styles.listItem}>You may experience a tingling sensation that we at ZYN call ZYNGLE.</li>
			</ul>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>For some users it can take some time using nicotine pouches before they get used to the tingling experience.  The tingling sensation you may get is an expected part of the experience, as your nicotine pouch gently releases nicotine and flavours into the gum.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>How long this tingling sensation lasts could vary from person to person. Some people may feel a slight tingling the entire time the pouch is in use, whereas others may only feel it for a few minutes.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>ZYN has designed a portfolio of products with different flavours and nicotine levels to offer you choices that satisfy your preferences.</p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>What Are Nicotine Pouches?</h2>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Nicotine pouches are typically found as small, pillow-shaped pouches that contain nicotine, cellulose and flavourings. Being tobacco-free and combustion-free, nicotine pouches can be an alternative to smoking. However, exactly what a nicotine pouch contains, and whether it is a viable smoke-free alternative to cigarettes, will depend on the specific product.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Take our range of ZYN nicotine pouches as an example. ZYN is the innovative, high-quality alternative to smoking that delivers unique flavours and a smoke-free nicotine experience wherever, whenever.</p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>When and Where Can I Use Nicotine Pouches?</h2>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>You might be able to use nicotine pouches in various different places. Possible areas where you could use nicotine pouches include at home, on the go, in the office, on public transport and more. However, it’s important to note that exactly where you can use nicotine pouches will depend on the specific location. Each space may have its own set of rules to adhere to when it comes to this topic, so it’s always important to check before using nicotine pouches where you are.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Nicotine pouches typically provide a discreet, smoke-free and device-free experience. Being smoke-free, tobacco-free and device-free, nicotine pouches are unlikely to cause any bother to those around you.   Nor do they leave any smoke smell or odour on hair or clothes like cigarettes.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>In comparison to this, with tobacco products, the choice of where and when they can be used has become increasingly more restricted. The same is often true of tobacco-free alternatives like vapes too. Even though they usually produce vapour instead of smoke, the same rules that apply to cigarettes are often also applied to vapes – which may prevent their use on public transport, in restaurants and so on.</p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>Nicotine Pouches - Usage and Quantities</h2>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>How often you use nicotine pouches will depend on a couple of factors, such as your own personal preferences and the product you’re using. Nicotine pouches can come in a range of different sizes, flavours and strengths, which may offer varying experiences.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>How many ZYNs a day do people have? Some adult users may only have a couple of ZYN pouches a day, others may have more. How many ZYNs a day you have may be influenced by the type of experience you prefer as well as which ZYN product you’re opting for - as ZYN’s products come in different sizes and nicotine strengths.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>If you’re a smoker or vaper looking for a tobacco-free alternative we’d propose to start with the lower nicotine strengths (6mg) and Mini pouches from the ZYN range.   Looking for a fuller nicotine experience? Choose ZYN’s range of Strong to XX-Strong nicotine pouches. </p>

 			<p className={styles.paragraph}>You can find out more on which nicotine strength of ZYN may suit you via our article on ‘What Strength of ZYN is Right for You?’</p>

			 <h2 className={styles.subTitle}>Are Nicotine Pouches Better Than Vaping?</h2>
			
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Nicotine pouches and vapes offer different types of experiences. Therefore, whether nicotine pouches are better than vaping may depend on the type of experience you prefer.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Generally, nicotine pouches don’t produce vapour, and don’t require a device. However, the way that nicotine pouches are often used varies significantly from vaping. When vaping, users typically draw vapour from the device’s mouthpiece for a nicotine experience. With nicotine pouches, users instead usually place a pouch under their lip.</p>

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Ultimately, when it comes to nicotine pouches vs vaping, the specific products you’re considering and the type of experience you’re wanting will affect the answer to this.</p>

			<h2 className={styles.subTitle}>Where to Buy ZYN Nicotine Pouches</h2>
			
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>You can purchase ZYN nicotine pouches online (check out the page <Link to="../where-to-buy">Where to Buy</Link>), but they are also widely available in several stores and local retailers.</p>
			
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>Smoke-free products are not risk-free and provide nicotine, which is addictive. The best decision any adult smoker can make is to quit tobacco and nicotine use altogether. Smoke-free products are not alternatives to quitting and are not designed as cessation aids.</p>
